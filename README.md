# Lorti UI Classic.

Darkens the default UI.

Big thanks to the original creator of this UI, Lorti. This is simply updated to work with the Classic client and does not work with any other vanilla/private server client.

>**IMPORTANT INFO REGARDING THE FUTURE OF THIS ADDON**
I am no longer playing Classic. I am not playing Classic TBC, and will not try fixing any issues.
I dont know whats causing issues. 

If you want a similar addon. Check out UberUI Classic or AbyssUI.
